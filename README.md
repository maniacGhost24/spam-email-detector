# Email Spam Detector

## What does the jupyter notebook does.

Using the dataset, provided to us on the link [Dataset Link](https://github.com/Shreyakkk/Email-Spam-Detector/blob/master/spam.csv). We count the words that are frequently used in spam emails and plot a boundary according to the three types of kernels (Linear,Polynomial and Radial), and check if the emails for testing fall inside or outside of the boundary, to check if it's spam or not.


### Steps to view the notebook.

1. Clone the repository.
2. (If you don't have jupyter notebook installed) Use `pip install notebook` (for windows.)
3. Run jupyter notebook from terminal using command `jupyter notebook` (for windows).
